# Graphs
To change to function of the graph, find the line labed 'FUNC' and change it into a function in the form y=. When the program is running, press 'n' for a new pair of axis, then left click to place the axis. The program will then graph the funciton of x. There are some example function already in the code. The step changes how many values of x and y are produced.
